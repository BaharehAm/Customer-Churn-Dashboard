# Customer Churn Dashboard

This interactive dashboard leverages IBM's fictional Telco customer churn dataset to explore key factors influencing customer retention. The dashboard provides insights into customer behavior, churn rates, and service usage patterns. Visualizations include state-level churn filled map, churn distribution by internet service categories, and customer segments by payment methods and contract types. The dashboard also features dynamic tables to display top customers by total charges, helping to identify at-risk segments and areas for targeted retention efforts.
